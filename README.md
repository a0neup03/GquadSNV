# GquadSNV
Check SNV from COSMIC and CLINVAR databases occuring in G4 region
This repository contains scripts and data for analyzing single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the COSMIC and ClinVar databases that occur in G-quadruplex (G4) regions of the genome.

Key Components:

analysis_combined.R: Script for combined analysis of SNVs in G4 regions.

COSMIC_SNV.R: Script for processing SNVs from the COSMIC database.

COSMIC_getseq.R: Script to extract sequences from the COSMIC database.

G4_variants.R: Script for analyzing variants in G4 regions.

check_G4.R: Script to verify G4 regions in the genome.

function_G4Hunter.r: Function script for G4Hunter, a tool to predict G4-forming sequences.

GSM3003539_w15.hits.K.bed: BED file containing G4 region data.

Clinvar_G4.Rdata: R data file with ClinVar SNVs in G4 regions.

These tools facilitate the identification and analysis of SNVs from COSMIC and ClinVar databases that occur within G4 regions, aiding in the study of their potential impact on genomic stability and disease.
